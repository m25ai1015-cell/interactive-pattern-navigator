# Interactive Pattern Navigator

Explore, compare, and visualize **Software & Data Engineering** patterns—side-by-side.  
See relationships, trade-offs, tactics, and anti-patterns in an interactive, web-based platform.

> Built with **Microservices + MVC**, **FastAPI/Spring Boot**, **React/Vue**, and **Neo4j + PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch**.

## Why this project?

Learners and practitioners often know *what* a pattern is, but not *when* and *why* to choose it.  
**Interactive Pattern Navigator** bridges theory and practice by showing:
- Relationships among patterns (e.g., Broker ↔ Pub/Sub ↔ SOA).
- Quality-attribute trade-offs (latency, availability, security, modifiability).
- Common anti-patterns and migration paths (e.g., Monolith → Microservices).
- Live comparisons with examples, code snippets, and decision checklists.

## Core Features

- **Pattern Explorer**: Browse patterns with definitions, diagrams, pros/cons, tactics, and examples.
- **Compare View**: Select 2–4 patterns and compare QAs, tactics, deployment style, data flow.
- **Relationship Graph**: Neo4j-powered graph of patterns, tactics, anti-patterns.
- **Search & Filter**: Elasticsearch for full-text search (by QA, context, tech stack).
- **Playground Snippets**: Minimal code examples (FastAPI/Spring Boot; React/Vue).
- **Case Studies**: Realistic scenarios with recommended patterns and trade-offs.
- **Export**: One-click export of a comparison sheet (PDF/Markdown).
